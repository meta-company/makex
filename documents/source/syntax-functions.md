# Functions

Makex files have functions available which do different things:

## `task()`

This function defines a Task which will become part of the execution graph.

```{todo}
"target" is an overloaded term in software construction (e.g "target architecture").
```

The task function is defined as follows:

```{eval-rst}
.. py:function:: task(name, requires=None, steps=None, outputs=None)
  
  Define a Task.
  
  :param String name: Name of the task.
      
  :param list[PathLike] requires: A list of requrements. Can be files or other tasks using a task specifier, or using the `Task` function.
    A string with a : will be parsed as a task. Any values which evaluated to None will be skipped.
  
  :param list[Union[Action,list[Action]]] steps: A list of :ref:`actions`. These are actions/task/executables/scripts run in sequence as part of the task.
  
  :param list[PathLike] outputs: A list of the files this task outputs. If a task produces any files that are to be consumed by any dependendants of the task, they *should* be defined here. 
    Defining outputs makes the task a candidate for caching.
      
```

```{note}
In previous versions of Makex, this function was named `target()`; this is deprecated.
```

```{note}
This function is provided under the alias `Task()` as `task` may be a commonly used macro local variable/argument.
```

<!--
path=None,
:param list[PathLike] path: Path to the task's output directory.
This will be automatically generated by default. You may define a path shared between
tasks by assigning a variable with the :py:func:`path` function and passing the returned Path.
  .. note:: The `path` argument is deprecated and may be removed, or placed behind a flag. 
     It's absolutely unsafe.
-->

Blank example of creating a task named `name`:

```python
task(
    name="name",
    requires=[
        
    ],
    steps=[
        
    ],
    outputs=[
        
    ]
)
```


## Paths

Makex standardizes on paths with `/` as a separator.

Paths in Makex files may not contain the `..` (double dot) marker.

<!--
This shouldn't be a problem unless you are on Windows and doing something specific.

If you need a different seperator for a Path object use the {py:class}`WindowsPath` object.
-->

```{note}
Any specifics or problems in the {py:mod}`Python pathlib module <pathlib>` will show up in Makex.
```

## Path()

To refer to arbitrary paths use the `Path` object.

```{eval-rst}
.. py:class:: Path

    A path object. Similar to :py:class:`pathlib.Path`. Paths can be concatenated with separators
    by using the `/` operator.
    
    .. py:attribute:: name
      :type: String
      
      The name of the path; typically a file name. This is the last component/part of any given path.
      The name of the root is an empty string.
      
```
<!--
### WindowsPath()

```{eval-rst}
.. py:class:: WindowsPath

    A path object. Similar to :py:class:`pathlib.PureWindowsPath`.
```
-->

## task_path()

The `task_path()` function will return the output {class}`Path` for the specified task.
See {doc}`the Tasks<tasks>` and {doc}`the Cache<caching>` documentation for more about Task output paths.

```{todo}
Since `path` is a common variable (e.g. in a loop), and as an argument (to Tasks), 
and also a class/object {class}`Path`, we should provide the alternative functions `cache()` or `build()`. 
All of these functions do the same thing.
```


```{eval-rst}
.. py:function:: task_path(name:String, path:PathLike=None) -> Path
  
  Returns an output path for a task with `name`. If the `path` argument is specified, returns the output path corresponding
  to the task with the matching `name` inside `path`.  
  
  The output path of a task is typically `Task.directory / "_output_" / Task.id`.
  
  :param name: Name of a task.
  :param path: Optional. A directory containing a Makex file.
    Workspace relative paths are accepted here.
    
```

```{note}
If `DIRECT_REFERENCES_TO_MAKEX_FILES` is enabled, the `path` argument may be a path to a Makex file.
```

## home()

```{eval-rst}
.. py:function:: home(*path:PathLike=None) -> Path
  
  Return a Path that evaluates to the current user's home directory.
  
  :param path: Optional. A subpath in the home directory.
```


## find()

```{eval-rst}
.. py:function:: find(path:PathLike, include:Union[Pattern,Glob]=None) -> list[Path]
  
  Finds files. If path is relative, it will be resolved relative to the folder of the makex file.
  
  Note: this function is intended to be used as part of Task or its actions; find will not return/resolve otherwise.  
  
  :param path: A path to search for files in.
  :param Union[Pattern,Glob] include: Files to include. If specified, only files matching the include will be returned.
```

## glob()

```{eval-rst}
.. py:function:: glob(pattern:String=None) -> Glob
  
  Prepares/compiles a glob pattern.
  
  Note: this function is intended to be used as part of Task or its actions; glob will not return/resolve otherwise.  
  
  :param pattern: Patterns of files to include.
```

Folder/Recursive patterns: `**` (e.g. `**.py` will match python files in any directory)
Match a file with extension `*.py`
Match files with multiple extensions `*.{py,md,txt}`
